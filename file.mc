Crime: There is a couple agents from a group called "The Agency", who have been going around the server, closing off perfectly legit operations of business, and plundering goods.
--- Page 1 ---
This is unnaceptable, and I believe that they must be brought to justice.

It has been brought to my attention, that JoeHills, is currently constructing a court house, as he is one of the many who has been affected by these haneous crimes.
--- Page 2 ---
Before you discard this report because it is about you Agent B & X. Please think back to your agency training. You will remember that you must take all crimes, no matter who they are commited by, and bring them to justice. I trust you will honor the oath 
--- Page 3 ---
you uttered with your tea-eating mouthes infront of the Queen of England on December, 10th, 2012.

May all your emeralds turn into tea leaves you jerks.

WARNINGNING- The extra ing is how ingportant it is to not steal my ideas cuase I thought them up.
----------
Last time the Doctor and Xisuma blew up the pok√©mon parliament and then the ponies were all gone and biffa told them the ponies were gone.
--- Page 1 ---
So the Doctor didn't wanna stay becuase he liked Xisuma too much and when he loves osmeone too much they die and this is not forshadowing that xisuma will die because the doctor left before he could get hurt. So then it was just Biffa and Xisuma and NO
--- Page 2 ---
PONIES!!!!! Biffa said to Xisuma and the no ponies, oh no, we need to find the ponies." Everyone was asked by Biffa and Xisuma as they looked for the ponies where the ponies were, and everyone said that they were taken and that, "Etho did it!" And Xisuma 
--- Page 3 ---
knew that Ethos didn't do it because Etho was busy in his lab making mutagen so the turtles could come from New York and not be aliens next time J.J. Abrams got bored making fringe and tried to put the turtles in a movie. So since Xisuma knew that Etho
--- Page 4 ---
didn't take the ponies he had to ask himself who would want to frame Etho and take the ponies because someone who just wanted to fram ethos wouldn't have bothered to go through the trouble of taking all the ponies because they have a lot of
--- Page 5 ---
friendship and are hard to fight with and steal. So then the United Nations space command showed up and found Xisuma and Biffa and they had to sign a non-disclosure agreement and were like, whoa, what is going on here, but they signed it because they have
--- Page 6 ---
no fears of litigation by the united nations as the U.N.'s legal department is busy with refugees after the dragonball incident, and then they got taken by Samantha Carter from the stargate program through the startgate to the ancient ship Destiny where 
--- Page 7 ---
the ponies had assembled in friendship to magically protect the ship as it was being attacked by replicators from the atlantis expidition and not the ones from the original Stargate series because those weren't as good, and Xisuma said you have my pick
--- Page 8 ---
and Biffa said you have my axe and then there was someone else in the shadows who said you have my tires, and it was Herbie the 53 car from the Love Bug and now the drones are about to attack to be continued.

Sorry it took so long to get this chapter done guys, my cat got busy at school and I had to babysit the kittens more than usual to help her keep her grade up at the acatamy.

So Biffa and Xisuma and the ponies and Samantha Carter
--- Page 1 ---
were all nervous about the replicator attack but then Xisuma said, "Wait!! I'm a space marine biologist just look at my skin! I'm from Doom lime Paul Atriedies! and I have fought the hellspawn that attacked the settlement on mars! I can help us here!"
--- Page 2 ---
And then the friendship of the ponies and Biffa was so great that with the help of Xisuma's BFG, which is a big friendly gun, they magically shattered the replicators into bits! Also, I should mention that these are not star trek replicators, but stargate
--- Page 3 ---
ones that attack. So when the battle was over. So Samantha Carter wanted to thank Xisuma with a kiss, but she was too shy even though Biffa said that Xisuma didn't think he was better than her, even though he was wrong to think that. So then
--- Page 4 ---
battle had ended everyone realized "oh no, the stargate connection to Destiny is one way and we are trapped on the other side of the universe, literally billions of light years from Earth!" Even though Samantha Carter was happy to be trapped with Xisuma,

she knew that she should impress him by finding a way back to earth. Just when she had nearly done it by adjusting the crystals in the stargate control display even though it was dangerous, Xisuma pointed out that by killing all the monsters the door to

The ghost story of 
Colonel Void RAF Ret.

The streets of occupied Palestine were not crowded by the time the clubs closed, but as Colonel Void gentelmanly ambled back toward the officer's
--- Page 1 ---
barracks, he heard a group of children whispering in a language that he thought might be Czech. When he turned, he saw only the other officers being dragged away from the club by local girls headed toward their flats. Void, being a gentleman with a 
--- Page 2 ---
young lady in his heart in upper Cork, which the name of a place in england and not literally a physiological designation for a cardiac feaure. Unaware that the voices of the children would follow him home, he continued to the barracks, suprised 
--- Page 3 ---
that the voices of the children seemed to be following him home. It seemed as soon as his head hit his pillow that he was awoken by a tugging at his pajama bottom's ankle. He bolted upright, knife in hand, and quickly drew it to throat of a child he could
--- Page 4 ---
not see. Sensing danger, but blind to the threat, he feared that his drink had been tampered with, or perhaps his food. He sheathed his knife, and stumbled over an unseen child as he groped for the light.
 He knocked over his unlit lamp but managed to
--- Page 5 ---
push open his door. Collapsing into the hallway, he felt tiny hands grabbing at him, scooping into him, into the places he knew held the bits and shards and pieces of flak he'd collected in his leg in his days in the sky. Hot and sharp and pain and
--- Page 6 ---
distraction, so much distraction from the mission, from the misssions, lapped against his waking and he twisted and huddled and slammed himself against the door of his neighbor, trying to wake himself.
Blood and metal mixed on the fine carpet of the hotel
--- Page 7 ---
they'd commandeered and Void was found the next morning free of the shrapnel that had pained him since the war, free of the thoughts and dreams and fears that had haunted him as well.
Shuddering, stuttering, rocking, rambling, it was years until he spoke 
--- Page 8 ---
again, but never of anything between the day he put on his first uniform, and the day they wheeled him out from the hospital.
The metal was gone.
The shrapnel bloodied and discarded.
And who can say of the memories, as he never did himself.

now he was the thirteenth doctor, because the one before that was Guude, and the one before that was Matt Smith. The 13th doctor regenerated and was bald and only had a tooth and decided to be a hermit named generikb. So the old bald doctor flew his

nothing grows there except despair about the city's economy and then the DoctorB came out of the TARDIS and Xisuma was there in the garden with his pony friends and the ponies told Xisuma, "No, don't go! Your friendship is the most magical!" but DoctorB
--- Page 4 ---
said, "That is the friendship that I want to have for my adventure so I don't get blown up by another creeper." And then they flew away in the TARDIS and it made a noise and the ponies were scared without Xisuma.
The door of the TARDIS opened and

Saddle #1:
Date: Unknown
Time: Unknown
As far as I can tell, this saddle has been with me forever. A testament to my eternal life as the saddle hermit. It was destiny that I acquire it; and fate that I acquire more.
--- Page 1 ---
Saddle #2
Date: 9/12/2012
Time: 15:30 EST

Found this saddle within the clutch of a clutch of spiders. I wrestled with my arachid foes and bested them with my sword to claim my prize. I will sing it to sleep tonight.

Saddle #3
Date: 9/12/2012
Time: 19:39
I went through Generikb's obstacle  course to gain cyan wool - both for myself, and for joe. Joe apparently felt that a piece of wool was a fair trade for a saddle. I think I got the better end of the deal.

Saddles #4 and #5
Date: 10/10/2012
Time: 16:15
I found myself wandering around, wondering if I was lost or found. Upon a cave I stumbled, and it was not derpy. Inside was a pack of skeletons, safeguarding puns and saddles all the same. It was a good day.

Saddle #6
Date: 10/10/2012
Time: 18:00
A bizarre 6-sided rodent asked me for help spreading dust on the floor. He offered a saddle in exchange, and I couldn't say no. Three saddles in one day - possibly the happiest in my life. Happiest saddles.
--- Page 5 ---
Saddle #7
Date: 10/31/2012
Time: 15:30
A Mr. Mass contacted me in search of someone who understands the courting rituals of the villager people. I never knew why I was so good with them, but it seemed to sate his curiosity. Saddle get!

Saddes #8 and #9
Date: 11/7/2012
Time: 17:30
We were plotting out the land area for our quincunx underwater base when suddenly arachnids invaded our face! We slay them and they guarded my twin friends Leviathan and Kraken. I always liked the numbers 8&9.

Continued from the other lost manuscript...

The truck flew past GenerikB's Beetle as he pulled over, sideswiping him and forcing his car into a ditch. The truck did a quick 180 turn and slid to a halt. The fast and furious driver TopMass jumped out of 
--- Page 1 ---
the truck with a shotgun and yelled, "Hey, there was a guy with a hook hand on your passenger side door dressed as a pirate and I kept flashing my highbeams to let you know!" I'm not sure if he was a bad person or if he just happened
--- Page 2 ---
to be disabled and unfortunately stuck to your car, but at this point I have killed him. He is dead. We're gonna wanna tell the police he was attacking you."
GenerikB looked at TopMass and said, "Hey, Buddy, I already know how to hide the bodies of
--- Page 3 ---
the folks I kill while invisible, why don't we just dump this pirate guy with those?"
So the two returned toward the cemetary as the moon rose. Howls filled the air, as did the creepy laughter of children, some creaky door noises, and the whirring of a
--- Page 4 ---
VHS player with a girl in a well. "Noisy air we're having today" remarked GenerikB. Topmass assented. When they arrived at the cemetary, they had to sneak the body over the fence, because the gates were already closed.
--- Page 5 ---
As GenerikB selected an empty grave that'd be filled in the morning, they saw several vampires punch the sky, clawing their way from their earthly graves that they might yet walk again amongst the unsuspecting living.
Luckily for GenerikB and Topmass,
--- Page 6 ---
Aurey the Vampire Slayer was on patrol, and she stabbed the vampires in their hearts after jumping around and kicking them in their heads a few times. "Oh, Hai" said Topmass. And then Aurey the Vampire Slayer inquired about the body they were
--- Page 7 ---
burying.
Topmass pointed out his truck and said, "Qe work for the hospital in medical waste disposal. This guy was turning into a zombie and attacking people so we did what we usually do and pulverized his head and buried him in someone elses' grave
--- Page 8 ---
. This made about as much sense as anything else that had happened so far tonight, so Aurey continued on her way. GenerikB wiped a load of sweat off his his brow and said, "whew, that was close!" But it wasn't close at all because they hadn't actually 
--- Page 9 ---
destroyed the brain of the pirate guy with the hook, merely smashed his body with a truck and it turned out that he really did have quite an advanced case of the zombies. So he bit them both and everyone died and there was a big problem with that
--- Page 10 ---
when they eventually made it into a population center and bit more people and eventually there were rumors that Atlanta was the last safe place for humanity, but that was just a clever lie. Everyone died. The end!
